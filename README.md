#Nvision2016
The official desktop and mobile site for nvision2016 : Techno-management fest of IIT Hyderabad 
You can visit the website at [Nvision2016](https://nvision.org.in)

##Desktop Site
[React-JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) framework was used for development. I'll soon add the details about how to run it locally and how the various components are interlinked, etc.

##Mobile Site
I used [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com) library. Most of it features came quite handy in faster development, not compromising with the UI at the same time. It is certainly one of easiest yet sophisticated library based on material design.

The easiest wat to run this website locally is to open 'cmd' (win+R and type cmd in windows). Navigate to the containing directory (/Mobile) and run a simple python HTTP server. For it type - 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' (without quotes) and it will serve you at port 8000 probably. Get to know your IP address first from 'Network and Sharing Center' from control panel and selecting the network in use. Then type '[IP Address]:8000' in your address bar. 

##Experience
Being the web-coordinator for [Nvision](https://nvision.org.in) was a huge learning experience for me. The whole process from design to development was quite enthralling and I learnt a lot on the way. My main focus was on UX part as I wanted them to have a pleasant visit to our website. We focused a lot on 'ease of navigation' part. From the feedbacks that we got, I think we were successful in our endeavour.

I will publish the entire development story "**Diving Into The Developer's Dilemma**" on my blog [TheVindicatedAxiom](https://thevindicatedaxiom.wordpress.com). Stay tuned!
